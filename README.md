# The-Perfect-Guess
This is a small game created using Python in which we are writing a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it .
IF the player's guess is higher than the given number we ask the user to guess a lower number .
Similarly if the guessed number is lower than the given number then we ask the user to guess a higher number .
When the user guesses the correct number , the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive the number .
At this point a file named highscore.txt is storing the highscore of the previous user and is a user breaks this highscore (By guessing the given number in less attempts than saved in the highscore file ) then the program updates the highscore for future comparison .
